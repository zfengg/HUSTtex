  abstract  = {The distribution $\nu$$\lambda$ of the random series random series $\Sigma${\textpm}$\lambda$n is the infinite convolution product of These measures have been studied since the 1930's, revealing connections with harmonic analysis, the theory of algebraic numbers, dynamical systems, and Hausdorff dimension estimation. In this survey we describe some of these connections, and the progress that has been made so far on the fundamental open problem: For which $\lambda$∈ is $\nu$$\lambda$, absolutely continuous?},
